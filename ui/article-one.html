     <p>Users are used to scroll websites vertically on both desktop and mobile devices - but not horizontally! So, if the user is forced to scroll horizontally, or zoom out, to see the whole web page it results in a poor user experience. Some additional rules to follow:</p>   
<ol>
    <li>
        Do NOT use large fixed width elements - For example, if an image is displayed at a width wider than the viewport it can cause the viewport to scroll horizontally. Remember to adjust this content to fit within the width of the viewport.
    </li> 
    <li>
        Do NOT let the content rely on a particular viewport width to render well - Since screen dimensions and width in CSS pixels vary widely between devices, content should not rely on a particular viewport width to render well.
    </li>
    <li>
         Use CSS media queries to apply different styling for small and large screens - Setting large absolute CSS widths for page elements, will cause the element to be too wide for the viewport on a smaller device. Instead, consider using relative width values, such as width: 100%. Also, be careful of using large absolute positioning values. It may cause the element to fall outside the viewport on small devices.
